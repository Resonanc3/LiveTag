# LiveTag
This project is made from our Capstone during our Computer Engineering in our 3rd Year. My first application made from Flutter, with a huge help from my friend diffident012.

This applilcation is a tracking app from our dumb project, that tracks the live location of the cows. Basically we're gonna attach the GPS to a collar. The GPS has a separate code to run with Arduino, the GPS is a NEO6m because it's the only thing I could find with our budget.
